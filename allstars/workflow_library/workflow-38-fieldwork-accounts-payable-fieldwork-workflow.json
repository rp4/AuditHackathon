Authorization & Spending Limits\n- **Check signatory authority** for each sampled transaction.\n- **Verify compliance** with the organization's delegated authority matrix (DAM).\n- **Scan for overrides** where controls may have been bypassed by management.\n\n### 3. Vendor Master File Controls\n- **Review new vendor additions** during the period.\n- **Verify documentation** (W-9s, business licenses) and approval signatures for new entries.\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- [ ] Control Testing Matrix — document findings for each sample item\n- [ ] Deficiency Log — list of any control gaps or operating failures\n\n## Quality Criteria\n- All samples must be traceable to primary source documents.\n- Deviations must be investigated and documented with management's explanation.\n- Results should conclude on whether controls can be relied upon for substantive testing.",
