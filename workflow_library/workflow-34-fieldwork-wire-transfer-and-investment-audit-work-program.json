Investigate variances > 1%.\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- [ ] Cleaned dataset of all wire transfers (CSV/JSON)\n- [ ] Reconciliation memo confirming population completeness\n\n## Quality Criteria\n- Population must include successful, pending, and cancelled wires to test control effectiveness across all states.",
